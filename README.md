# Simulated Annealing Optimizer (Work in Progress)

Welcome to the repository of the most chill optimization algorithm out there, the Simulated Annealing Optimizer! It's like taking the concept of "cooling down" quite literally. üòé‚ùÑÔ∏è

# What's Cooking? üç≥

This optimizer is based on the concept of Simulated Annealing, where we metaphorically heat up a system and then slowly cool it down to find a state of minimum energy, or in our case, the optimal solution. It's like trying to find the comfiest spot on your bed, but mathematically!

# Current Status üöß

Hold your horses! üêé This implementation is still under construction. It's like a half-baked cookie, it has potential, but it's not quite there yet. We're regularly updating the code, adding sprinkles and chocolate chips to make it the best cookie... I mean, optimizer, it can be!

# The Code üßë‚Äçüíª

Here's a sneak peek at the code. It's written in C++ and uses Thrust for parallel operations. It's designed to be used with CUDA, so you can unleash the power of your GPU to find that sweet spot of optimality.

```
#include <thrust/for_each.h>
#include <thrust/execution_policy.h>
#include <thrust/random.h>

// Assuming _cons_prec_ntype is a macro for a constant precision numeric type
// It should be defined before using it, for example:
// #define _cons_prec_ntype float

template<typename ObjectiveFunction, typename NumericType>
class SAOptimizer {
public:
    SAOptimizer(ObjectiveFunction obj_func, NumericType temperature, NumericType& shared_optimal_value, NumericType* shared_optimal_parameters)
        : obj_func(obj_func), temperature(temperature), shared_optimal_value(shared_optimal_value), shared_optimal_parameters(shared_optimal_parameters), rng(), dist(0.0f, 1.0f) {}

    __host__ __device__
    void operator()(int idx, NumericType* vectors, NumericType* objective_values) {
        // calculate the objective value for the current vector
        NumericType current_value = obj_func(vectors[idx]);

        // Probabilistic acceptance criterion
        if (shouldAccept(current_value, objective_values[idx])) {
            objective_values[idx] = current_value;
            atomic_update_best_parameters(vectors[idx], current_value);
        }
    }

private:
    ObjectiveFunction obj_func;
    NumericType temperature;
    NumericType& shared_optimal_value;
    NumericType* shared_optimal_parameters;
    thrust::default_random_engine rng;
    thrust::uniform_real_distribution<NumericType> dist;

    __host__ __device__
    bool shouldAccept(NumericType new_value, NumericType old_value) {
        if (new_value < old_value) {
            return true;
        } else {
            NumericType acceptance_probability = exp(-1 * abs(old_value - new_value) / temperature);
            return dist(rng) < acceptance_probability;
        }
    }

    __device__ void atomic_update_best_parameters(float *address, float *params, int num_params, float new_value, float *best_params) {
        // ... (snipped for brevity)
    }
};
```

# How to Use üìñ

Currently, the optimizer is like a mysterious ancient artifact; it looks cool, but we're still figuring out how to use it properly. Stay tuned for updates, and we'll soon provide a comprehensive guide on how to integrate this optimizer into your quest for the global minimum.

# Contributions ü§ù

Feel free to fork this project, play around with the code, and submit pull requests. It's like a potluck; bring your own spices and let's make this dish even more delicious!

# Disclaimer ‚ö†Ô∏è

This code is not for the faint of heart. It's a work in progress, and like a wild roller coaster, it has its ups and downs. Use it at your own risk, and remember, with great power comes great responsibility (to debug).

# Stay Cool üòé

Remember, this optimizer is all about cooling down, so take a deep breath, grab a cup of coffee, and enjoy the process. Happy optimizing!
